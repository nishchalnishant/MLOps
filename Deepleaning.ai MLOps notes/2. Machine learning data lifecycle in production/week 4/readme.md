    	1. Semi-supervised Learning --

    		-


    		-

    		- With Semi-supervised labeling, you start with a relatively small dataset that's been labeled by humans.

    		- Then you'll combine that labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data, where you'll infer the labels for the unlabeled data by looking at how the different human labeled classes are clustered or structured within the feature space.

    		- Then you'll train your model using the combination of the two datasets.
