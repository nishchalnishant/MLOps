    		§ Helps manage whole ml lifecycle
    		§ Suitable for individuals and for tams of any size
    		§ Can work with any library
    		§ It has 4 main functions that helps us to track and organize experiments
    			□ Ml flow tracking -- api and ui doe logging , code version and artefacts
    			□ Mlflow projects -- packaging ml code in a reusable , reproducible form to share with other data scientist
    			□ Ml flow models -- managing and deploying models from different ml libraries to a variety of model serving and inference platform
    			□ Ml flow model registry -- central model store to collaboratively manage full lifecycle of ml flow model
